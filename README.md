AnimaGraph
==========

An UDK generated software that allows you to create graphs and run the algorithms of Dijkstra, Kruskal and Prim.

Unfortunately, at the time of the release, it's only available in Portuguese (Brazilian), so Localization is it's first priority.

In order to develop on it, all you need is a UDK installer copy, that can be downloaded from http://www.unrealengine.com/en/udk/downloads/

I recommend using either March 2013 (the one it's originally developed on) or July 2013 (it should work on it).

Just download and do a clean install (no UT3 Content). Perforce might help managing your files, but I didn't use it.

Then copy everything to the installation folder and you're good to go.

You might also need a version of Flash (Preferably CS6, will upload a CS5 version soon), and Visual Studio with nFringe.

But these are essentials when dealing with UDK.
