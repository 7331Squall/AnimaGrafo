This is a software made as a Bachelor's Thesis on March 2013 version of **Unreal Development Kit**, A.K.A. **UDK**, a now defunct free-to-use port of Unreal Engine 3, and heavily depends on yet another outdated software, like the **ScaleForm** middleware.

This software allows you to create graphs, define custom weights to those graphs edges, and run Dijkstra, Kruskal or Prim algorithms on them.

Also, this software is stuck in Portuguese and.... There's no way in hell I'm either updating this thing to work with Unreal Engine 4 (as I suck at C++), or porting it to Unity (since it'd be easier to start a project from ground up).

I used Flash CS6 (to make the ScaleForm stuff), and Visual Studio with nFringe.... whatever the hell that is. I think it was VS 2010 with an Add-On to support UnrealScript, but I'm not sure. The world moved on so much that even Epic will not allow you to download UDK anymore.

Anyway, once you get a working UDK version, do a clean install of it (which means no UT3 content, as it is not needed anywhere. I only used the Plasma Rifle Particle System to make the edges, and some SFX, but I had the decency of packing them on the UPK files under _Content/TCCGame_)

Once you do that, copy everything from this repository to its installation folder (WOW UDK didn't support separate projects???) and you're good to go.

Now, I'll leave the original Readme below. Even though you could read it in Git's history, I reckon it's a pretty good laugh, since I had NO idea what Perforce was back then.

Oh, and the CS5 version are SO not happening. Hell, Flash doesn't even exist anymore, it's Adobe Animate now...

An UDK generated software that allows you to create graphs and run the algorithms of Dijkstra, Kruskal and Prim.

Unfortunately, at the time of the release, it's only available in Portuguese (Brazilian), so Localization is it's first priority.

In order to develop on it, all you need is a UDK installer copy, that can be downloaded from:

http://www.unrealengine.com/en/udk/downloads/

I recommend using either March 2013 (the one it's originally developed on) or July 2013 (it should work on it).

Just download and do a clean install (no UT3 Content). Perforce might help managing your files, but I didn't use it.

Then copy everything to the installation folder and you're good to go.

You might also need a version of Flash (Preferably CS6, will upload a CS5 version soon), and Visual Studio with nFringe.

But these are essentials when dealing with UDK.
